# q1 Write a python code that uses three variables x, y, and z with respective values 10,20 and 30. Add all the
#variables and then store the result in variable a. Print the value of a
x=10
y=20
z=30
a=x+y+z
print(a)
# q2 Write a python program that takes courses marks as input and then calculates average of all the
#courses. After calculating the average, calculate the percentage of a student using total marks. Assume 
#the total of all the courses marks is 500 or take the total marks from the user as input. 
Ip=int(input("enter the marks of Ip:"))
Computer_Science=int(input("enter the marks of Computer_Science:"))
Eng=int(input("enter the marks of Eng:"))
sum=Ip+Computer_Science+Eng
average=sum/3
total=int(input("enter the total:"))
percentage=sum/total*100
print(percentage)
#q3 Write a python program that takes an input 5 from user and then type cast those values to string, int
# and float in the separate variables. Print all the variables
